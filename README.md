 # Automated Image Colorization using Image Processing and AI
 
This repository contains code for automatically colorizing black and white images using image processing techniques and AI. The colorization is performed using a pre-trained deep learning model implemented with OpenCV and Caffe.

# Clone the repository:


# git clone https://github.com/your_username/automated-image-colorization.git
Install the required dependencies:


pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib
Run the main.py script with your desired black and white image:

python main.py -i

Make sure to update the image_path variable in the script to point to your input black and white image.

The colorized image will be displayed using matplotlib. Additionally, the colorized image will be saved in the coloured_images directory.


Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
OpenCV
Matplotlib
